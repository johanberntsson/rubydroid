# rubydroid
This is a clone of the C64 game Paradroid with a new theme of modern robot graphics, written by Johan Berntsson in 2007.  The game uses Rubygame and SDL packages.

Either shoot the robots, or capture them. To capture a robot, press ENTER to enable capture mode. Then move into the robot you want to capture.

The game is over when all robots have been captured or
destroyed.
